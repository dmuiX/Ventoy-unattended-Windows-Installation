This is my currently not completely working solution to create an almost unattended windows 10 installation with installation of applications via chocolatey. 
I publish this because I did not find any other working solution for ventoy public. Take it as an inspiration to create your own thing.

No warranty that anything is working correctly.
You are using it at your own risk.

Thanks a lot to the dev of ventoy and easy2boot to provide their software.
